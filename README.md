# SlapJack-
This is my honors Project for Comp 2150 ( Data Structures). 
Honors Project Description: 
The student will recreate a card game called SlapJack using Python.
The student will:
Draft a plan that describes any additional requirements, constraints, or variations the student has chosen to apply to the original problem and the student's approach to the solution.
Submit source code for their project and a UML class diagram of their solution.
Meet with the instructor to give a 5-10-minute demonstration of their project's features.
The student is not required to achieve 100% of their plan in their final submission to receive honors credit.
This project constitutes an honors component of the course in which the student must invest additional time in practicing and studying Python compared to what is required in the non-honors section of the course.
